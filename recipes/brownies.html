<h4>The No-Fail Secret to the Chewiest, Fudgiest Brownies Ever</h4>

<p> Grab a bar of Baker's Semi-Sweet Chocolate off the shelf, and when you get home, get to work on the batter. Pour batter into the baking pan, unwrap the chocolate bar, which is scored into ¼-ounce pieces. Break off half of them—eight out of 16 total—and scatter them throughout the batter</p>
<p>What makes these brownies the peak of chocolatey perfection is the contrast between the crisp top layer and the fudgy interior. And technique plays an important role: The chocolate pieces <b>need</b> to go into the batter whole, not roughly chopped. Finally, as the chocolate pieces sink into the batter and melt, the bottom layer of the brownies becomes a thin layer of solid chocolate.Be sure to take the pan out of the oven about 20 minutes into the baking process and bang it on your counter a couple times. This knocks all the excess air bubbles out of the batter, which results in a denser texture and encourages the top layer to crack. To banish any possibility of a dry interior, you can also experiment with slightly underbaking the brownies, although it might take practice to get the timing just right <em>(you don't want to bite into raw batter!)</em>. The best baking time is 40 to 45 minutes.</p>
